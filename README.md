### Hi there 👋
I graduated from Ho Chi Minh City University Of Technology,  major in 
Environmental Engineering. But after working I felt interested in Information 
Technology so I studied a programming course at CyberSoft Academy. 
By the effort of myself and the effort to learn plus the experience accumulated 
during  the working process, I want to continue to advance in my job to higher 
position like, Senior, ...

I’m currently work as Developer at Zigvy Corporation
